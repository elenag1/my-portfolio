<h1>Elena Garcia</h1>

<div class="container">
    <p>Hello,my name is Elena Garcia. I like playing volleyball and basketball. I'm also in advanced math in school. I'm in the 8th grade at Thrall Middle School. I have a little sister named Isabella and I adore her. I was born and lived in Mexico. When I was 5 we moved here to the United States and now we have moved all around. One of the reasons I signed up is because I want to show my mom that I can get a really good job when I'm older. She wants the best for me.  If I learn how to code I could get a good job in the future. I think coding is very fun and exciting, it gives you a new way to look behind the scenes. I would really recommend you looking into a class to learn to code or even choosing it as a career. </p>
